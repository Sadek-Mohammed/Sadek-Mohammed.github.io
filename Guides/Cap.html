            Capstone Project is a per-semester project, done at my school to solve one of Egypt's 11
            Grand
            Challenges. In that project, a portfolio (in the form of a research paper) is written, a
            fully-working hardware prototype is built, and a poster is deisgned for the Exhibition (a 10-min
            presentation in front of Egyptian University Professors).
            The projects contributes to 60% of the total grade of each and every subject in my school during grades 10
            and 11, which gives the project a special significance as one of the main grading criteria in the school's
            system.

                        Egypt's water resources are mainly used for irrigation and agricultural purposes (over 77%), and
                        that consumption is almost-completely dependent on the River Nile which provides Egypt with 55.5
                        billion cubic meters of Freshwater, representing about 75% of Egypt's water resources. That
                        daunting dependence on the River Nile encourages further research on other reliable resources of
                        clean water.

                        In Egypt, 89% of the industrial processes are located in Cairo and some northern governorates,
                        which relates to how poor is industry in the other parts of Egypt. Furthermore, manufacturing
                        output represented only 20% of Egypt's Gross Domestic Product, employing 20% of the active labor
                        power. The last thing to consider is the quality of products, and as the social life in Egypt is
                        getting worse, the quality of products decreases daily.

                        Egypt's population is reasonble relative to its area; however, the real problem is with its
                        distribution. More than fifth of Egypt's population (19 million inhabitants) live in Cairo,
                        Egypt's biggest city, with a density that ranges from 40,000 people in each square kilometer to
                        100,000 people in older districts.

                        The untolerable population density in Cairo encourages further research on how to distribute

                        Egypt is the largest non-OPEC oil producer in Africa, so 95% of the population has access to
                        Africa; however, the per-capita consumption is too much. In the period from 2003 to 2014, the
                        per-capita electricity consumption increased from 1128.721
                        kWh to 1657.769 kWh, and the percentage is still increasing with the increased use of
                        technological devices.

                        Egypt's population increases by about 1.5 million people each year, which is an extremely
                        unacceptable rate as Egypt's population will reach 160 million people by 2050. Another problem
                        is that the biggest portion of the population is of age less than or equal to 9 years old,

                        Due to a dramatic increase in Egypt's population, Egypt's total amount of Greenhouse Gases
                        (GHGs) increased from about 130 Metric Tons of CO<sub>2</sub> Equivalent (Mt. CO<sub>2</sub>) to
                        about 320 Mt. CO<sub>2</sub> from 1990 to 2016. This economic change is accompanied with
                        decreases of Agriculture, Health Expenditures, and Labour Productivity in Egypt, encouraging
                        further research.

                        Egypt produces about 60 million tons of solid wastes per year; however, only a small fraction of
                        all of that is properly recycled. Conflicts with the Egyptian Governement, some companies, and
                        local garbage collectiors made the companies obliged to recycle 20% of the waste which far less
                        than the waste collectors whose methods of waste managing are lacking.
