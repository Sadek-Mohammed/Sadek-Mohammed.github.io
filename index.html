                            CP is a type of programming that depends on spending time trying to invent creative
                            solutions for problems. Solutions are mainly pieces of code, based on a mathematical base.
                            That mixture of mathematics and code is what I mainly love in CP. Furthermore, CP satisfies
                            my interest in spending hours thinking and formulating ideas on paper. I got an "A" in the
                            11th grade CS curriculum, putting me beside the top students at my class. I particpate in

                            The English Club | Writing Branch was founded by me, where I had to put a curriculum. I
                            have
                            designed
                            a curriculum that consists of 10 sessions whose content was picked from the <a
                                href="https://www.amazon.com/Writers-Choice-Grade-11-Composition/dp/0078887763">Glencoe
                                Writer's Choice Grammar and Composition</a>, a book recommended by my teacher. To
                            introduce
                            the
                            club to the younger students, I and the other mentors have organized an orientation
                            session that
                            were attended by Mr. Samir Abdelrahman, english teacher at my school and the club's
                            supervisor.
                            Next, I have
                            opened registeration for younger students at my school. After that, I had to distribute
                            the 44
                            students over me and the other 10 mentors to start the mentoring programs. For the following
                            two months, I kept giving
                            sessions
                            and
                            following the progress of the other mentors. Each session discussed a certain unit of
                            the book,
                            assigned a certain task, and revised the task of the previous sessions.

                            I started working on the Deutsch Club with the start of the 11th Grade. The main task was to
                            mentor a
                            class of 22 students who were new to German. That included solving practice questions,
                            studying the
                            curriculum, and following up via WhatsApp.
                            In the second term, Herr. Mohammed Zaki, the school's head german teacher, wanted to improve
                            the level of
                            Deutsch in the school. That's why he started preparing all students in Grade 10 on the
                            Goethe Institut in Kairo's German A1 Curriculum. I had the duty of preparing the students to
                            the
                            test,
                            alongside Abdelrahman Sameh Ghamry - a classmate.

                                Most of the students marked their first encounters with German.

                            One of my school's distinctive traits among the other Egyptian schools is the existence
                            of a
                            per-semester Capstone project that uses knowledge from all STEM subjects to solve one or

                                Grand Challenges of Egypt</a>. The capstone consists of 3 parts: Portfolio,
                            Prototype, and
                            Poster, where each of them requires intense revision, especially for students in the
                            10th Grade
                            who
                            are still new to that sort of academic work. After finishing the work, a mock exhibition
                            is
                            prepared
                            for those students to familiarize them to the process of evaluation and presenting
                            projects before the real exhibition. The real exhibition is presented for University
                            Professors
                            from
                            the top
                            Egyptian Universities.
                            I have revised Capstone project through the first and
                            second semesters of the 11th Grade, and although I do revise Capstone Projects in the

                            I got an "A" in my Grade 11 Math curriculum, putting me beside the top maths students in

                            shcool.
                            Away from the intense Math curriculum that I take at school, I did research through the

                            university for 2 months. In
                            addition to my experience with the program, I experience Math with each and every

                            Coding problem
                            I solve. That's because informatics problems almost always depend on mathematical

                            a formula, or a

                            the
                            two
                            elements above it with putting 1s on diagonals) for the sake of introducing a
                            generalized
                            formula
                            for any triangle that is formed the same way as Pascal's triangle but with sets other
                            than
                            1s on the
                            diagonals. Next, the paper introduces the pracitcal use
                            of the invented formula in the process of proving some conjectures (formulas that were
                            previously set by
                            another
                            researcher and went
                            unproved). After that, the paper introduces other formulas for the sum of rows of
                            triangles,
                            where
                            each
                            entry is the result of adding 4, 6, or 8 elements above it with any set on the
                            diagonals.
                            Finally, by noticing the similarity of the generalized formula for 2, 4, 6, and 8
                            triangles,
                            I could
                            propose a conjecture that works for any Pascal-like (Pascalized) triangle where each
                            entry
                            is
                            the
                            result of
                            adding any number of entries from the above row with any set on the diagonals, inviting
                            other
                            researches
                            to find a formal proof for it.

                            I had three main causes to join. The first is that I have personally seen people who
                            suffered from
                            the huge jump between the normal Math classes and the Calculus ones, so I was encouraged
                            to
                            decrease
                            the severe suffering that the next calculus learners will face. The second reason is
                            that
                            through
                            solving informatics problems, I have sensed the importance of problem-solving skills
                            which
                            pushes me
                            forward into introducing other people to the refreshing feeling of being able to solve
                            problems &
                            conquer formulas. The third reason was that the period of working on that project
                            conincided
                            with my
                            first days with my Math combinatorics research paper, and I really loved it, so I wanted
                            to
                            work
                            beside a group of math enthusiasts and have a closer look into their Calculus concepts.
                            All
                            of those
                            reasons surged me into putting my tech experience to boost their workflow.

                            I had the role of building the website along with my 2 peers. Building the website
                            consisted
                            of many
                            parts: doing extensive edits into a pre-existing template, implementing advanced
                            functions
                            such as
                            contact forms and LATEX-integrated questions, and developing the backend temporary exam
                            gate. The
                            backend gate was a sort of a database that stores the examinees, their emails, and
                            scores.
                            In
                            addition, it stores the exam questions and corrects them using reference correct

                            Throughout
                            all of those endeavors, I had to collaborate with my friends using zoom & other

                            and project's requirements put by the Egyptian Ministry of Education). In short, the
                            challenge focused some points. From the millions of
                            ways to
                            improve industry,
                            the project
                            specified the necessity of using a feedback control mechanism, which is an automated system
                            that
                            controls the quality of the product and makes decisions on whether the product was ideal or
                            not.

                            addition to
                            boosting industry, the project had the aim of helping to sustain the environment by
                            restricting
                            the

                            requests urgent help. That encouraged me to choose a multi-purpose industry. In addition to
                            the decrease in the number of industries, the quality
                            of
                            the
                            products is really bad
                            Improving industry, limiting unemployment, and
                            sustaining environment make up a satisfying mix for a devloping country. That's why I was
                            sure that the feedback control mechanism I would use will work on making the quality better.
                            Finally, my team preferred working on a green energy source to make the industrial process
                            feasible - even in the harshest times.

                            My father, a pharmacist, was usually laughing about the Gentian Violet (GV) solution, an
                            anti-microbial solution. He used to say that it is a gram of powder + some goofy amount
                            water, and that was enough for pharmaceutical companies to sell 25mL for ~10 EGP, which was
                            too high in my father's Point of view. From the early beginnings of the project, I thought
                            of that industry as our perfect solution: the only component was accessible and
                            controllable. Another reason is that Gentian Violet is used in other industries, too, as a
                            dye. My team proposed the feedback control mechanism for Gentian Violet to depend on pH. If
                            the gentian violet concentration becomes too much, the solution turns acidic, and dilation
                            is needed to adapt. Otherwise, on lower concentrations, the soution is basic/neutral, and
                            adding more GV is required. The arduino, two pumps (one for water & the other for GV), and
                            pH sensor are required for controlling the whole process. Finally, solar panels were added
                            to provide the prototype with a green source of energy.

                            Egypt has always been a country of agriculture, and I cannot forget my grandfather's stories
                            about the best banana kilogram that he bought immediately after the 1973 war (I can
                            confidently claim that each and every Egyptian can claim to ). That
                            encouraged my team to work on utilizing the sources of water for agriculture. For a team,
                            working on agriculture was a convenient goal: agriculture usually accepts all sorts of
                            water, unless the water's pH isn't suitable for the specific field or TDS (Total Dissolved
                            Solids) was too high that it means the presence of heavy metals or too low that it refers to
                            the absence of salts. Among the various types of water that could be utilized (domestic,
                            rainwater, underground water, and others), my team found rainwater more convenient as it was
                            the focus of the 10 <sup>th</sup> Grade challenge.

                            The project depended on a container that holds waiter and a heater. The project's idea was
                            simple: we need to heat water and, then, condense the water again to get the pure water
                            particles to condense together (without pollutants) in the collecting place, returning to
                            the liquid water state. That desalinator has the advantage of using a slope to fasten the
                            movement of particles towards the collection place. A brilliant addition to the protoype was
                            adding the aluminium sulphate (alum) powder, which is a cheap desalinator that forms
                            easily-segregated compounds with pollutants - easing the process of water desalination.

                            Once entering the school, my team studied the scientific method & history of science in the
                            physics and chemistry sessions. One of the main points that the origin of science depended
                            upon was putting natural phenomena (God's creations) into action in scientific
                            breakthroughs. Our team took the compact shape of beehives as a model for our protoype to
                            follow as it stores the most honey per the provided area. In addition, pushed by the
                            diminshed, flooded homes of the thousands of Egyptians living on the Northern Coast area, we
                            recommended the use of the prototype there to utilize the 200 mm/yr of rainfall (considered
                            the highest in Egypt).

                            The most interesting part about the project was the workflow of the team. The team was all
                            new to scientific research, and two of us went to schools with all-arabic curriculum before
                            getting to my STEM school. In addition, COVID-19, along with inexperience, forced the team
                            into communication problems for the first month. We faced problems while doing everything
                            from planning to executing. Although teams in the 10<sup>th</sup> grade consist of 5
                            members, everyone's poor experience made everyone have double responsibilities. with time,
                            all of us utlilized their resarch, writing, and planning experience into better outcomes,
                            and I participated in all of the group's activities (thinking, discussions, testing the
                            protoype, and offline gathering instead of the cancelled school meetings). I could also
                            design our poster and learned how to present in an engaging way for the Exhibition Day.

                            Since we were obliged to use the Wooden Tongue Depressors, we had to consider all of the
                            possibilities of wood glue, and we chose the PolyVinyl Acetate (PVA) glue due to its
                            strength, cheap price, and water resistance. The prototype was prepared by gluing the Tongue
                            Depressors together, cutting the trapezoidal faces of the prototype, and gluing them
                            together into the beehive shape. The epoxy resin was our coating material due to its
                            strength against various weather conditions. It's important to avoid neglecting the amount
                            of geometry used to calculate the dimensions of that trapezoidal pyramid prototype and the
                            amount of chemistry needed to understand the way glues work with wood. All of those
                            different sciences resulted in learning enough information for our exhibition.

                            Before entering my STEM school, I spent hours struggling to learn web developement, and
                            although I learnt alot and built some cool websites' parts, I wasted some time on
                            poorly-made resources and wasn't learning efficiently. In addition, I was somtimes put down
                            due to missing a supporting community that could encourage me. That's why I didn't refrain
                            from joining the web devleopmenet team at my school, and while being a participant, I have
                            never missed a single meeting in spite of the heavy tasks and the amount of new information.
                            I enjoyed exploring my passion
                            with that group of inspiring peers, and the thing I was mostly eager to do was applying the
                            new information into real-world apps & websites. That's why I kept copies of the project I
                            have done during the club's season.

                            The first project was in the start of the season, when we were still learning about the
                            elementary CSS3 techniques (Flexbox and Grid). An image file was given (in the repo folder)
                            with the intended design, and I toned my flexbox skills via trying to code the design, and I
                            thankfully did so. The website was simple, and so was the code. The second and third tasks
                            were done in a two-week-period just before the start of the new school year. They were the
                            final tasks in the season and, consequently, were longer websites with more details. Despite
                            the amount of details in the website, it was easier to be coded due to the fact that we
                            learned the bootstrap CSS library which fastens the process of coding longer websites.

                            pitch, I
                            had to prepare for possible questions like choosing the APIs (automated services that are
                            publicaly accessible) and cloud-based services that will manage
                            text-to-braille conversion, how will the device communicate, and others. Finally, I
                            extensively contributed to the

                            CodeBozu, primarily managed by 2 cornell Undergraduate CS students, is an initiative that
                            has the goal of providing free education to the students in Python and related Computer
                            Science Areas (Data Analysis, Image Processing, and etc) in simple & interactive ways. I
                            joined the CodeBozu fellowship as an advanced scholar that has to do a web scraping python
                            project, working in a team of other 4 international students. The project's instructions
                            were given in a file, and it consisted of two parts. The first one ordered us to program a
                            script that can navigate all WikiPedia pages that contain presidents' biographies and grasp
                            data from them and explore trends (things like the most repeating month of birth and how
                            many children do most presidents have). The other part was to explore 5 news' websites (like
                            the DailyMail), find articles that talk about presidents, and figure out how much does that
                            specific website love the president.

                            There were two main factors that encouraged me to join CodeBozu: rigor and application. For
                            the rigor part, knowing that scholars will be supervised and taught by undergraduate
                            students from a rigor institution made me to learn as a science, which was a goal that I had
                            since beginning to explore CS. When I started exploring web devleopement before high school,
                            I didn't love the idea that many tutorials were on how to <strong>"BUILD"</strong> a website
                            not how to <strong>"LEARN"</strong> the intricacies of building websites. For the
                            application part, I learnt many advanced algorithms & data structes; however, away from
                            solving some problems, I didn't have an opportunity to put them into action in real-life
                            applications. Getting data from websites, managing them, and storing them were the things
                            that put my skills into action.

                            could distribute tasks equally upon us. After many problems, mid-year exams for most of the

                            I loved that challenge due to having a sentimental team and a passion for JavaScript (JS).
                            Since
                            I joined a STEM school, I had an opportunity to meet a group of ambitious students from my
                            school and other STEM schools. The out-of-my-school students, who I met during my first
                            school year, made up my team, and I was extremely proud to work with an interacting team,
                            especially because I was used to individual work for the past few years. I used to devleop
                            websites before entering my STEM school, and I explored JS as a top-tier website
                            developement language. What I discovered after a period of JS website developement is that
                            JS can be used in desktop and mobile apps. I tried to explore those fields, but I got
                            overwhelmed with those new words, so I stopped learning about them. Anyways, that project
                            urged me to quickly learn a programming language to use in the project. A quick JS review
                            was what rescued me.

                            widening their physics and programming knowledge for the project. Teamwork was at its MAX,
