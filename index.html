                            CP is a type of programming that depends on spending time trying to invent creative
                            solutions for problems. Solutions are mainly pieces of code, couped with a concrete
                            mathematical base.
                            That mixture of mathematics and code is what I mainly fancy about CP as it satisfies my love
                            for interdesciplinary fields. Furthermore, CP unleashes my full brain power by providing me
                            with a platform to practise my ideas on paper. Although those problems required spending a
                            lot of alone hours, practising alone in my room, I managed to make that process more
                            collaborative by organizing meetings at the school's Hack Club and Computer Science Club.

                            The English Club | Writing Branch was founded by me, where I had to put a curriculum. I
                            have
                            designed
                            a curriculum that consists of 10 sessions whose content was picked from the <a
                                href="https://www.amazon.com/Writers-Choice-Grade-11-Composition/dp/0078887763">Glencoe
                                Writer's Choice Grammar and Composition</a>, a book recommended by my teacher. To
                            introduce
                            the
                            branch to the younger students, the other mentors and I have organized an orientation
                            session that
                            were attended by Mr. Samir Abdelrahman, english teacher at my school and the club's
                            supervisor.
                            Next, I have
                            opened registeration for younger students at my school. After that, I had to distribute
                            the 44
                            students over the other 10 mentors and me to start the mentoring programs. For the following
                            two months, I kept giving
                            sessions
                            and
                            following the progress of the other mentors. Each session discussed a certain unit of
                            the book,
                            assigned a certain task, and revised the task of the previous sessions.

                            I started working on the Deutsch Club with the start of the 11th Grade. The main task was to
                            mentor a
                            class of 22 students who were new to German. That included solving practice questions,
                            studying the
                            curriculum, and following up via WhatsApp.
                            In the second term, Herr. Mohammed Zaki, the school's head german teacher, wanted to improve
                            the level of
                            Deutsch in the school. That's why he started preparing all interested 10<sup>th</sup>
                            graders for the
                            Goethe Institut in Kairo's German A1 Test. I had the duty of preparing the students to
                            the
                            test,

                                Most of the students marked their first encounters with German.

                            One of my school's distinctive traits among the other Egyptian schools is the existence
                            of a
                            per-semester Capstone project that uses knowledge from all STEM subjects to solve one or
                            more of
                            the

                                Grand Challenges of Egypt</a>. The capstone consists of 3 parts: Portfolio,
                            Prototype, and
                            Poster. Each of them requires intense revision, especially for students in the
                            10th Grade
                            who
                            are still new to that sort of academic research. After finishing the work, a mock exhibition
                            is
                            prepared
                            for those students to familiarize them to the process of evaluation and presenting
                            projects before the real exhibition. The real exhibition is presented for University
                            Professors
                            from
                            the top
                            Egyptian Universities.
                            I have revised Capstone project through the first and
                            second semesters of the 11th Grade. Although I do revise Capstone Projects in the
                            12th
                            Grade,
                            all statistics here belong to the 11th Grade work.

                            I got an "A" in my Grade 11 Math curriculum, putting me beside the top maths students in

                            shcool.
                            Away from academics, I did research through the
                            Pioneer Academics
                            program with <a href="https://dresden.academic.wlu.edu/">Prof. Greg Dresden</a> of W&Lee
                            university for 3 months. In
                            addition to my experience with the program, I experience Math with each and every
                            Compeitive
                            Coding problem
                            I solve. That's because informatics problems almost always depend on mathematical

                            a formula, or a

                            rows of
                            the
                            Pascal's triangle (A triangle that is formed by making each element the result of adding
                            the
                            two
                            elements above it with putting 1s on diagonals) for the sake of introducing a
                            generalized
                            formula
                            for any triangle that is formed the same way as Pascal's triangle but with sets other
                            than
                            1s on the
                            diagonals. Next, the paper introduces the pracitcal use
                            of the invented formula in the process of proving some conjectures (formulas that were
                            previously set by
                            another
                            researcher and went
                            unproved). After that, the paper introduces other formulas for the sum of rows of
                            triangles,
                            where
                            each
                            entry is the result of adding 4, 6, or 8 elements above it with any set on the
                            diagonals.
                            Finally, by noticing the similarity of the generalized formula for 2, 4, 6, and 8
                            triangles,
                            I could
                            propose a conjecture that works for any Pascal-like (Pascalized) triangle where each
                            entry
                            is
                            the
                            result of
                            adding any number of entries from the above row with any set on the diagonals, inviting
                            other
                            researches
                            to find a formal proof for it.

                            I had three main causes to join. The first is that I have personally seen people who
                            suffered from
                            the huge jump between the normal Math classes and the Calculus ones, so I was encouraged
                            to
                            decrease
                            the severe suffering that the next calculus learners will face. The second reason is
                            that
                            through
                            solving informatics problems, I have sensed the importance of problem-solving skills
                            which
                            pushes me
                            forward into introducing other people to the refreshing feeling of being able to solve
                            problems &
                            conquer formulas. The third reason was that the period of working on that project
                            conincided
                            with my
                            first days with my Math combinatorics research paper, and I really loved it, so I wanted
                            to
                            work
                            beside a group of math enthusiasts and have a closer look into their Calculus concepts.
                            All
                            of those
                            reasons surged me into putting my tech experience to boost their workflow.

                            I had the role of building the website along with my 2 peers. Building the website
                            consisted
                            of many
                            parts: doing extensive edits into a pre-existing template, implementing advanced
                            functions
                            such as
                            contact forms and LATEX-integrated questions, and developing the backend temporary exam
                            gate. The
                            backend gate was a sort of a database that stores the examinees, their emails, and
                            scores.
                            In
                            addition, it stores the exam questions and corrects them using reference correct
                            answers.
                            Throughout
                            all of those endeavors, I had to collaborate with my friends using zoom & other
                            communication
                            softwares as well as using version control websites such as Github.

                            challenge focused some points. Building on the COP-27 conference, the ministry wanted us to
                            work on a project that helps with the climate crisis. From the millions of ways of
                            mitigating climate change effects, methods depending on internet of things (IOT) were
                            required. That was to build accurate data that are human-efficient.

                            interactive graphs. By using the <i>Sample Skewness</i>, the website could automatically
                            give conclusions on which actions to do to stop climate change.

                            the rise of sea level in action. The four sensors (air-quality sensor, water-level sensor,
                            pH sensor, and temperature sensor) get the parameters' readings from the environment and
                            send them to the ESP. The ESP board connects to the Firebase database and stores data there.
                            Then, our frontend website fetched the data from the database and used JS libraries to put
                            them into interactive graphs. Another library was used to calculate some statistical
                            parameters that were put into graphs, too.

                            requests urgent help. That encouraged me to choose a multi-purpose industry. In addition to

                            My father, a pharmacist, was usually laughing about the Gentian Violet (GV) solution, an
                            anti-microbial solution. He used to say that it is a gram of powder + some goofy amount
                            water, and that was enough for pharmaceutical companies to sell 25mL for ~10 EGP, which was
                            too high in my father's Point of view. From the early beginnings of the project, I thought
                            of that industry as our perfect solution: the only component was accessible and
                            controllable. Another reason is that Gentian Violet is used in other industries, too, as a
                            dye. My team proposed the feedback control mechanism for Gentian Violet to depend on pH. If
                            the gentian violet concentration becomes too much, the solution turns acidic, and dilation
                            is needed to adapt. Otherwise, on lower concentrations, the soution is basic/neutral, and
                            adding more GV is required. The arduino, two pumps (one for water & the other for GV), and
                            pH sensor are required for controlling the whole process. Finally, solar panels were added
                            to provide the prototype with a green source of energy.

                            Egypt has always been a country of agriculture, and I cannot forget my grandfather's stories
                            about the best banana kilogram that he bought immediately after the 1973 war (I can
                            confidently claim that each and every Egyptian can claim to ). That
                            encouraged my team to work on utilizing the sources of water for agriculture. For a team,
                            working on agriculture was a convenient goal: agriculture usually accepts all sorts of
                            water, unless the water's pH isn't suitable for the specific field or TDS (Total Dissolved
                            Solids) was too high that it means the presence of heavy metals or too low that it refers to
                            the absence of salts. Among the various types of water that could be utilized (domestic,
                            rainwater, underground water, and others), my team found rainwater more convenient as it was
                            the focus of the 10 <sup>th</sup> Grade challenge.

                            The project depended on a container that holds waiter and a heater. The project's idea was
                            simple: we need to heat water and, then, condense the water again to get the pure water
                            particles to condense together (without pollutants) in the collecting place, returning to
                            the liquid water state. That desalinator has the advantage of using a slope to fasten the
                            movement of particles towards the collection place. A brilliant addition to the protoype was
                            adding the aluminium sulphate (alum) powder, which is a cheap desalinator that forms
                            easily-segregated compounds with pollutants - easing the process of water desalination.

                            protoype needed much research and adjustements as it contained concepts water desalinators,
                            heat, energy, and other multi-disciplinary concepts. Since the protoype consisted of zero

                            Depressors together, cutting the trapezoidal faces of the prototype, and gluing them
                            together into the beehive shape. The epoxy resin was our coating material due to its
                            strength against various weather conditions. It's important to avoid neglecting the amount
                            of geometry used to calculate the dimensions of that trapezoidal pyramid prototype and the
                            amount of chemistry needed to understand the way glues work with wood. Knitting various
                            sciences into our project resulted in an <i>A+</i> after the exhibition.

                            Before entering my STEM school, I spent hours struggling to learn web developement.
                            Although I learnt a lot and built some cool websites' parts, I wasted some time on
                            using poorly-presented resources and couldn't learn efficiently. In addition, I was somtimes
                            put down
                            due to missing a supportive community that could encourage me. That's why I didn't refrain
                            from joining the web devleopmenet team at my school. While being an active participant, I
                            have
                            never missed a single meeting in spite of the heavy tasks and the new information.
                            I enjoyed exploring my passion
                            with that group of inspiring peers, and the thing I was mostly eager to do was applying the
                            new information into real-world apps & websites. That's why I kept copies of the projects I
                            have done during the club's season.

                            The first project was in the start of the season when we were still learning about the
                            elementary CSS3 techniques (Flexbox and Grid). An image file was given (in each repo's
                            folder)
                            with the intended design. I toned my flexbox skills via trying to code the design. The
                            results made me grateful for the opportunity to do so: the website was simple, and so was
                            the code. The second and third tasks
                            were done in a two-week-period just before the start of the new school year (11<sup>th</sup>
                            Grade). They were the
                            final tasks in the season and, consequently, were longer websites with more details. Despite
                            the amount of details in the websites, it was easier to be coded due to the fact that we
                            learned the bootstrap CSS library which fastens the process of coding longer websites.

                            team and I participated, contained about 800 young changemakers from 80+ countries, forming
                            65 teams. The competition mainly consisted of a platform to give youth mentoring and guide
                            them into making innovate ideas that do really make change.
                            My
                            team and I got the 2 <sup>nd</sup> place for an idea that helps people with deaf-blindness,

                            Most of the team members came from poor communities that are extremely affected by any
                            slight
                            changes in finances, dollar exchange rate, and, even, governmental loans. In those
                            countries, getting
                            as many family members as possible to work is <strong>REALLY</strong> as crucial as
                            decreasing the expenses. If the family has a person that is deaf or blind, the
                            whole family is destined to suffer: less
                            income
                            from the sick person & more expenses for their cure. In addition to financial hardships,
                            deaf <strong>OR</strong>
                            blind people suffer from many social problems due to being unable to contact with their
                            peers, so
                            what about being deaf <strong>AND</strong> blind? That
                            thought inspired the project makers to help the 15 million people world wide that suffer
                            from that
                            disease.

                            Since the competition is online, the project wasn't required to be made in a hardware form.
                            The
                            first sort of modelling was the idea
                            canvas. Then, the project was modelled as being a braille-text and speech-braille
                            translator:
                            when
                            someone speaks a message, the message is converted into braille (language for blind people)
                            text. On the other hand,
                            there is a
                            braille keyboard that converts braille text to either speech or sends messages as a response
                            to the
                            sender. That idea was enough for the final idea pitch; however, we did more improvements.
                            During the period between the idea canvas and the final pitch, more decisions on
                            the
                            project's design were disucssed, starting from the method of translating the braille text to
                            the
                            other physical design parts. For starters, the keyboard was designed in a smaller form with
                            fewere number
                            of
                            keys, the use of solar panels was finally agreed upon (became lighter to ease
                            transportation), and,
                            finally, the cloud services (or APIs) that will help the voice-to-braille and vice versa
                            automatically
                            were
                            carefully chosen. The result of plans on the funding, preparations, and diagrams were a
                            strong plus
                            to
                            the presentation.

                            As the top tech enthusiast in the group, I was responsible for managing each and every

                            aspect of the project. From building <a href="https://braille-brains.netlify.app/">the

                            in a single day to managing the smallest details of the project's workflow. Besides
                            technological aspects, I
                            extensively contributed to the
                            research process while trying to find the idea, how it will work, and enhancements.
                            Finally, for the final
                            pitch, I
                            had to prepare answers for possible questions like the reasons for choosing the APIs
                            (automated services that are
                            publicaly accessible) and cloud-based services that will manage
                            text-to-braille conversion, how will the device communicate, and others.

                            CodeBozu, primarily managed by 2 cornell Undergraduate CS students, is an initiative that
                            has the goal of providing free education to the students in Python and related Computer
                            Science Areas (Data Analysis, Image Processing, and etc) in simple & interactive ways. I
                            joined the CodeBozu fellowship as an advanced scholar that has to do a web scraping python
                            project, working in a team of other 4 international students. The project's instructions
                            were given in a file, and it consisted of two parts. The first one ordered us to program a
                            script that can navigate all WikiPedia pages that contain presidents' biographies and grasp
                            data from them and explore trends (things like the most repeating month of birth and how
                            many children do most presidents have). The other part was to explore 5 news' websites (like
                            the DailyMail), find articles that talk about presidents, and figure out how much does that
                            specific website love the president.

                            There were two main factors that encouraged me to join CodeBozu: rigor and application. For
                            the rigor part, knowing that scholars will be supervised and taught by undergraduate
                            students from a rigor institution made me to learn as a science, which was a goal that I had
                            since beginning to explore CS. When I started exploring web devleopement before high school,
                            I didn't love the idea that many tutorials were on how to <strong>"BUILD"</strong> a website
                            not how to <strong>"LEARN"</strong> the intricacies of building websites. For the
                            application part, I learnt many advanced algorithms & data structes; however, away from
                            solving some problems, I didn't have an opportunity to put them into action in real-life
                            applications. Getting data from websites, managing them, and storing them were the things
                            that put my skills into action.

                            At first, we had problems with organizing tasks: we were from different countries, woke up
                            on different times, and have variable experinces in the tech field; however, with time, we
                            could distribute tasks equally upon us. After many problems, mid-year exams for most of the
                            team members, 4 deliverables, and 35 commits on the github repo, we could finish both our

                            Nasa Space Apps, an international competition, has many locations in each country, where
                            each location has a number of paritcipants who are ranked according to their project. The
                            first three places qualify to the international competition. My team got the first place
                            in the Giza location and qualified to the international round. The competition was offline,
                            and it had many projects to choose from. Out of the offered project choices, my team and I
                            chose
                            the "You are my Sunshine" challenge that helps the people's lives by giving each person
                            concise data about the amount of data science in any certain time instance. The team had the
                            task of developing an app that takes location and represents the data of that location
                            (brought from Nasa's database) in an
                            app. In addition, a delightful presentation that sums up

                            I loved that challenge due to having a sentimental team and a passion for JavaScript (JS).
                            Since
                            I joined a STEM school, I had an opportunity to meet a group of ambitious students from my
                            school and other STEM schools. The out-of-my-school students, who I met during my first
                            school year, made up my team. I was extremely proud to work with an interacting team,
                            especially because I was used to individual work before joining my STEM school. I used to
                            develop
                            websites before entering my STEM school, and I explored JS as a top-tier website
                            developement language. What I discovered after a period of JS website developement is that
                            JS can be used in desktop and mobile apps. This project made up my first opportunity to use
                            JS as a mobile developement programming language. In addition to trying JS, the project was
                            my first interdesciplinary project. Specifically, I, with my peers, managed to use Computer
                            Science and Data Science to accomplish what is mainly an energy engineering project.

                            I and Ezzat, a teammate, had to do all CS-related tasks, ending up nearly non-sleep for the
                            48 hours. Meanwhile, the rest of the team worked on finalizing the other parts of the
                            competition: producing interactive designs, editing videos, doing the presentation, and
                            widening their physics and programming knowledge for the project. Teamwork was at its MAX,
                            then. More info about the workflow in our Nasa Space Apps Page.
