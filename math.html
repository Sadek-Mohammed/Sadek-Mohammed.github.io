            I got an "A" in my Grade 11 Math curriculum, putting me beside the top maths students in my shcool.
            Away from the intense Math curriculum that I take at school, I did research through the Pioneer Academics
            program with <a href="https://dresden.academic.wlu.edu/">Prof. Greg Dresden</a> of W&Lee university. In
            addition to my experience with the program, I experience Math with each and every Compeitive Coding problem
            I solve. That's because informatics problems almost always depend on mathematical analysis, a formula, or a
            sort of logical thinking, which is what I love Math for.

                    Summary
                </h3>
                <p class="summary-body">
                    The paper starts with a quick look into the known formula of the sum of the elements in the rows of
                    the
                    Pascal's triangle (A triangle that is formed by making each element the result of adding the two
                    elements above it with putting 1s on diagonals) for the sake of introducing a generalized formula
                    for any triangle that is formed the same way as Pascal's triangle but with sets other than 1s on the
                    diagonals. Next, the paper introduces the pracitcal use
                    of the invented formula in the process of proving formulas that were previously set by another
                    researcher and went
                    unproved. After that, the paper introduces other formulas for the sum of rows of triangles, where
                    each
                    entry is the result of adding 4, 6, or 8 elements above it with any set on the diagonals.
                    Finally, by noticing the similarity of the generalized formula for 2, 4, 6, and 8 triangles, I could
                    propose a formula that works for any Pascal-like (Pascalized) triangle where each entry is the
                    result of
                    adding any number of entries from the above row with any set on the diagonals, inviting other
                    researches
                    to find a formal proof for it.
